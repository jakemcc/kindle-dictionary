    <h3>Usage</h3>
    On modern (as of 2013/06/23) e-ink Kindle's running recent software all you should
    need to do to use this dictionary is to get it onto your Kindle.
    You can do this by using the USB connection or by emailing the
    dictionary to the email address associated with your Kindle. Once
    it is on your Kindle you simply look up words like you would any
    other word in a dictionary. Older versions of the Kindle may
    require more work.

    <h3>Details</h3>
